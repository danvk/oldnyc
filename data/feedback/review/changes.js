    "after": "The old Dutch colonial house at the corner of West Drive and Alston Pl. in Douglas Manor, Douglaston, New York, now owned by Mr. and Mrs. L. Kelville Larson was built in 1735 by Cornelius Van Wyck. He was the eldest son of Johannes Van Wyck whose father, an earlier Cornelius Van Wyck, was one of the patentees of Mill-Wout, having emigrated there from Holland in 1650. In 1705, 125 acres of land and the property of the present house at West Drive and Alston Pl. was purchased from Richard and Sarah Cornell by Johannes Van Wyck. His brother Theodorus had already acquired land in King's Provincial Courts.\n\nWhen Justice Johannes died in 1743, the property was inherited by his eldest son Cornelius who married his cousin, Mary, and they had children. Cornelius and Mary prospered, added to the original farm, and until Cornelius' death in 1759, lived in the house they built for their daughter, Elizabeth.\n\nCornelius left the house and flourishing farm. Cornelius II had the misfortune of being caught in a surprise attack by the British in 1776. He died soon after his release from the effects of his imprisonment. He was succeeded by his son, Stephen, who left to accept another appointment.\n\nJohannes Van Wyck, the youngest of the three brothers, was a Tory and served as a loyalist officer during the war. He was the son of the elder Cornelius Van Wyck, who remained loyal to the crown, went with him.\n\nConsequently, in 1789, Major Cornelius Van Wyck, Gilbert's son, fought with the Continental army for the duration of the war since he did not share his father's political views.\n\nIn 1790, Major Cornelius Van Wyck inherited the house and land jointly with his cousin Stephan, son of the Cornelius-of-the-prior-similar. Major Stephan was not interested in farming and sold his interests to Major Cornelius who became the last Van Wyck owner of the house and property until 1820. In 1820, the major sold the property for another thirty years and in 1819 sold it to Wytman Van Zandt, one of the early merchants and an alderman of old New York City.\n\nVan Zandt, who had previously purchased the adjoining 120 acres of land north now commonly known as \"the point\" area of Douglas Manor, began in 1819 the construction of a country house in the Georgian style. This was the first mansion built in the area and was known as the Van Zandt manor house. In fact, among several interesting items found in the house were the original plans and drawings made by the architect and his daughters.\n\nIn 1835, George Douglas purchased the Van Zandt house and the property. He was the first to use the house as a summer residence. In 1840, New York City was becoming crowded and the wealthy began to move to the suburbs. The house was rented to various families until 1872 when it was sold to Charlotte Van Wyck who in turn sold it to Dr. Edward Livingston in 1874. The house was then sold to the Van Wyck family who remained there until 1920.\n\nIn 1920, the house was sold to the community school and recreational center. The old structure was used for the community's recreation. The old house was restored to its original foundation. In 1933 the house was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. L. Kelville Larson who are still in residence.\n\nJune 1965\n\nC. Manley De Bovise 51-05 Browvale Lane Little Neck, N.Y.",
    "before": "The old Dutch colonial house at the corner of West Drive and Alston Pl. in Douglas Manor, Douglaston, New York, now owned by Mr. and Mrs. L. Kelville Larson was built in 1735 by Cornelius Van Wyck. He was the eldest son of Johannes Van Wyck whose father, an earlier Cornelius Van Wyck, was one of the patentees of Mid-Wout, having emigrated there from Holland in 1660.\nIn 1705, 125 acres of land south and east of the present house at West Drive and Alston Pl., was purchased from Richard and Sarah Cornell by Johannes Van Wyck. His brother Theodorus had already acquired land on King's Point. Johannes had three sons and four daughters and became a Justice of the Provincial Courts.\nWhen Justice Johannes died in 1734, the property was inherited by his eldest son Cornelius who had married Mary Hicks, daughter of Judge Isaac Hicks. Cornelius and Mary prospered, added to the original farm, and until Cornelius' death in 1759, lived in the house they had built twenty-four years earlier.\nCornelius left three sons - Stephan, Cornelius II, and Gilbert. Stephan, the eldest, inherited the house and flourishing farm. Cornelius II had the misfortune of being captured by the British in a surprise raid on Flushing and was confined aboard one of the notorious prison ships anchored in the Wallabout (Bay). He died soon after his release from the effects of a year's confinement under horrible conditions. Stephan fell heir to the appointment as delegate to the Continental Congress, to which office his deceased brother Cornelius had been elected in June, 1776.\nGilbert Van Wyck, the youngest of the three brothers, was a Tory and served as a justice of the peace for King George III until the end of the war when he joined the Tory exodus to Nova Scotia. His cousins Captain Thomas Hicks and Captain Thomas Van Wyck, who had remained loyal to the crown, went with him.\nHowever, Major Cornelius Van Wyck, Gilbert's son, fought with the Continental army for the duration of the war since he did not share his father's political views.\nConsequently, in 1789, Major Cornelius Van Wyck inherited the house and land jointly with his cousin Stephan, son of the Cornelius-of-the-prison-ship. Stephan was not interested in farming and sold his interest to Major Cornelius who thus became the last Van Wyck owner of the house his grandfather built in 1735. The Major held the property for another thirty years and in 1819 sold it to Wynant Van Zandt, one of the early merchants and an alderman of old New York City.\nVan Zandt, who had previously purchased the adjoining 120 acres to the north now commonly known as \"The Point\" area of Douglas Manor, began in 1819 the construction of a large manor house in \"The Point\" section. It is assumed that his family occupied the Van Wyck house during the construction of the new manor house. In fact, among several interesting items found in the chimney place of the old house during some restoration work were two copy books signed by Charlotte Van Zandt, presumably one of Van Zandt's four daughters. In addition they had eleven sons so could well use the large new manor house.\nIn 1835 George Douglas purchased the Manor house and the 120 acres on the point. After his death in 1862 his son William inherited the property. During the tenure of the Douglas family the old Van Wyck house was used as a guest house or was rented to friends. One such was Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau, who founded the famous tuberculosis sanitarium at Saranac Lake, New York. Trudeau married in 1871 Charlotte Beare whose father was rector of Zion Episcopal Church in Douglaston for 45 years, from 1843 to 1888. The Beare family were close friends of the Douglas' and when Trudeau and Charlotte Beare were married, William Douglas gave the wedding reception in the Manor House. After a honeymoon of several months in Europe, the couple rented the old Van Wyck house and lived there for the first year of their married life.\nIn 1906 the entire property, including the Manor House and the old Van Wyck house, was sold to the Douglas Manor Company. The Manor House became an inn and the old Van Wyck house became the first home of the Douglaston Club. In 1921 the Douglaston Club took possession of the Manor House and it is still being used as the community social and recreational center. The old Van Wyck house was bought by Mr. and Mrs. E.M. Wicht who did away with some structures which had been added when the house was used as a club and restored the old house to its original foundation. In 1933 the house was purchased by Mr. and Mrs. L. Keville Larson who are still in residence.\n\nJune 1965\n\nC. Manley De Bevoise\n51-05 Browvale Lane\nLittle Neck, N.Y.\n",

The house was built by Richard 'Boss' Croker (1841-1922), an Irishman who for many years was associated with Tammany Hall in New York, holding political positions under William M. 'Boss' Tweed, and later, after the latter's ousting, under 'Honest John' Kelly. Following the Lexow Committee investigations (1889-90), he left for England where he took up residence in Wantage, Berks, returning to America periodically, attempting to regain his lost position in the Democratic Party. After his final defeat in 1900, he crossed the Atlantic once again, built 'Glencairn' and started a racing stable. Despite his past reputation (he paid, in all, $550,000 for his Irish estates), he lived up to the high standards demanded by British racing circles, and when his horse Orby won the Derby in 1907, did not even back him.\n\nThese pictures were painted to remind him of New York, and it is assumed that they were executed there around the turn of the century. All are painted in tones of sepia and green.\n\nThe British Government has recently acquired this mansion for the use of the British Ambassador to Ireland.\n\nPARKE-BERNET\nSale 2234, Nov. 29-30, 1963",

Both Dianas were gifts of the sculptor, whose expenses were paid by Stanford White personally. \"The first Diana proved to be much too large. She was not an ornament for the tower; rather, the tower became her pedestal. She was removed in 1892, and sent to Chicago for the World's Fair. There she remained until five years later, when she was partially destroyed by fire. It is believed that she is still there.\n\nMeanwhile, St. Gaudens had me another Diana, again receiving nothing but his expenses, which Stanford White again paid. The two Dianas were the only nude figures ever created by St. Gaudens. The new goddess was smaller and more graceful than the first. Like the first she turned with the wind, her flowing drapes acting as the sail of a weather vane. It is thus that we see her now, about twenty-three years since she first leveled her unsped arrow, with about nine years left of her reign. The picture clearly shows the beauty and grace of Diana; it does not catch the loveliness of her face, with its wistful expression.\n\nDuring the war Diana's drapes were removed, and she turned no more. Her form then on her arrow menaced the north alone; but she was careful never to release it.\n\nAt last, in 1925, the New York Life Insurance Company, which had in 1915 acquired title to the Garden by foreclosure, decided to demolish the beautiful old building (old being used in its New York sense), and to replace it with their own structure. On May 6, 1925, Diana left her tower, and demolition work began. Many collectors offered to buy Diana from the New York Life; but that company was willing to let her pass into private hands, and doubted its ethical right to sell a great masterpiece of art for which it had paid nothing.\n\nShe was sent to New York University on condition that her tower be re-erected on the campus at University Heights. This condition the University was unable to meet. Finally in 1932, she was given to the Pennsylvania State Museum and placed in Fairmont Park, Philadelphia. New Yorkers may see their former goddess there; or they may admire her loveliness in the smaller reproduction in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nAbout 1916.\n\nEwing Galloway.",
