    "after": "(2)\nTenth Avenue, east side, north from Little West 12th Street. View 3 is the same.\n\nP. L. Sperr\n\nABOUT NEW YORK\n\nBy MEYER BERGER\n\nApril 24, 1910\n\nThe yardmaster's shack trembled as the freight string lumbered by. Red coals shivered in the rusty potbelly stove. Dispatchers' books lay on the desk.\n\nWhen the string had gone by the yardmaster stared through the window at the flow of converging tracks. He said the Death Avenue Cavalry was out down now; only three riders.\n\nPete O'Connor, a glum West Sider of the P. M. & M. road, said: \"It's the same every day. You make two or three trips a day.\"\n\nA man in cap and dungarees leaned against the yard. He flopped onto a bench; stared into the coals. He listened to the talk while he was a rider.\n\n\"I wish I had a horse once by the name of Tickleback,\" Tacked said. \"I wouldn't go past Seventeenth Street, you couldn't make me.\"\n\nPete O'Connor leaned against the boarding. He said: \"We ain't got Tacked here no more. We got Cyclone Tom and Midget.\"\n\nThe riders are men grown up rather than boys. Most of the riders always had names like Tacked, and George Hayde and Marty Ahern.\n\n\"Hayde,\" he said, \"didn't he make a name for himself?\"\n\nThe man who had been listening turned around. \"I heard the other day he was riding the tops of cars and kicking the frongs up through the ground.\n\nViaducts will carry the freights above Tenth Avenue within the year, and that means the end of the riders, the yardmaster reflected.\n\n\"They've been so long riding the avenue,\" he said, moodily. \"Ever since 1880. That's a hundred years, when you think of it.\"\n\nThe first three and thirty riders jogged along the drifting looks; they were worn out by busy drivers and the jigs that made them feel like a city law,\" the yardmaster said.\n\nOn hot Summer days, forty-fifty years ago, West Sider trucks filled the street behind the riders. They dreamed of growing up to be riders, as Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer dreamed of growing up to be Mississippi steamboat pilots.\n\nSummer day still held some of its former atmosphere. Old Mike Rags, who was the only one left, was still there, herding a dozen or so, while the flanks were busy in huddles.\n\nIn the days when New York Central stopped hiring boys. Riders had to stop riding, or their numbers were dropping off.\n\nIn those old days people called the riders \"the boys\" and they had a special light engine. A special light engine was a special engine.\n\n\"Officially they were called the riders,\" he said.\n\nThe man who had been listening said: \"I was a rider in the morning.\"\n\nHe said: \"The kids would try to throw you off when I was riding. They would holler, 'Paul Revere! Here comes Paul Revere!'\n\nThirty years ago most of the riders were women who rode the freight horses. Their legs would give in two years on the cobbles.\n\n\"Put rubber pads on the shoes,\" he said. \"That's how we do now.\"\n\nWomen riders were sold at the Bull's Head Auction over on Third Avenue. Nowadays mounted men are good for seven years. That's how we do now.\"\n\nO'Connor the rider stared out through the window. \"Sometimes, they try to throw you.\"\n\nThe line of freights darkened the window. It was a long line that scared tin flooring under the weight.\n\nA moment from the yardmaster's shack at Thirty-third Street and Eleventh Avenue on shipping schedules the rider's booth at Tenth Avenue and Thirteenth Street. No one was there.\n\nThe riders' rectangular booth was called a \"Miss.\" It was a Miss, and it was a Miss, and it was a Miss.\"\n\nTo cross the street, the riders had to be careful. They would climb into the saddle and would jump into the street, and the horses' backs, rhythmically bobbing and gigantic motor trucks.",

An engine house with a turntable stood where the Armory is now located, and there was a roundhouse or engine house in the block where the Park Avenue Hotel is shown. The name Park Avenue was first applied to that portion of Fourth Avenue between 34th and 42nd Streets, and is so shown on maps, with the little green parks in the middle of the avenue in each block, as early as 1867. Above 42nd Street the name Park Avenue was not applied till nearly 1890. After the building of the first Grand Central Station in 1870, train service down to Madison Square was discontinued, and the tunnel taken over by the horse-cars. In 1898 this surface line was electrified. In 1935, when the Madison and Fourth Avenue street cars have been superseded by buses, the tunnel will be remodeled for automobile traffic.\nOn the east side from 32nd to 33rd Streets stand the barbarns of the Metropolitan Street Railway; they will be torn down in 1925. The 71st Regiment Armory, shown in the next block, was erected in 1893. On the west side of the avenue, the Park Avenue Hotel, built by A. T. Stewart in the 1870's, will give place in 1926 to the new No. 2 Park Avenue building. On either side of 33rd Street may be seen subway entrances; the subway has been open about two years. The 333rd to 34th Street block, west, will be demolished in 1910 to make room for the Vanderbilt Hotel.\nOn the horizon may be seen the new Hotel Belmont on the southwest corner of 42nd Street, and one dome of the old Grand Central Station. Compare this picture with Galloway's view of the west side of the avenue, looking north from this point, in 1930.\n\nBrown Brothers, Photographers.",
