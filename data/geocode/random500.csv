These paintings come from a country house called 'Glencairn' near Dublin in Ireland, where they adorned the walls of the billiard room. The house was built by Richard 'Boss' Croker (1841-1922), an Irishman who for many years was associated with Tammany Hall in New York, holding political positions under William M. 'Boss' Tweed, and later, after the latter's ousting, under 'Honest John' Kelly. Following the Lexow Committee investigations (1889-90), he left for England where he took up residence in Wantage, Berks, returning to America periodically, attempting to regain his lost position in the Democratic Party. After his final defeat in 1900, he crossed the Atlantic once again, built 'Glencairn' and started a racing stable. Despite his past reputation (he paid, in all, $550,000 for his Irish estates), he lived up to the high standards demanded by British racing circles, and when his horse Orby won the Derby in 1907, did not even back him.

These pictures were painted to remind him of New York, and it is assumed that they were executed there around the turn of the century. All are painted in tones of sepia and green.

The British Government has recently acquired this mansion for the use of the British Ambassador to Ireland.

Feast of St. Anthony of Padua, 1932 (Children's Feast), No. 1. This year, as the country neared the bottom of the depression of the 1930's, the Bruscianese colony could not afford their annual festival. The children, accordingly, decided to have one of their own. Here they are shown rallying around their tower at the N.E. corner of First Avenue and 106th Street, on Labor Day.
September 5, 1932.

The Street car tunnel is the old tunnel under Murray Hill cut by the New York and Harlem Railway in its early days. An engine house with a turntable stood where the Armory is now located, and there was a roundhouse or engine house in the block where the Park Avenue Hotel is shown. The name Park Avenue was first applied to that portion of Fourth Avenue between 34th and 42nd Streets, and is so shown on maps, with the little green parks in the middle of the avenue in each block, as early as 1867. Above 42nd Street the name Park Avenue was not applied till nearly 1890. After the building of the first Grand Central Station in 1870, train service down to Madison Square was discontinued, and the tunnel taken over by the horse-cars. In 1898 this surface line was electrified. In 1935, when the Madison and Fourth Avenue street cars have been superseded by buses, the tunnel will be remodeled for automobile traffic.
On the east side from 32nd to 33rd Streets stand the barbarns of the Metropolitan Street Railway; they will be torn down in 1925. The 71st Regiment Armory, shown in the next block, was erected in 1893. On the west side of the avenue, the Park Avenue Hotel, built by A. T. Stewart in the 1870's, will give place in 1926 to the new No. 2 Park Avenue building. On either side of 33rd Street may be seen subway entrances; the subway has been open about two years. The 333rd to 34th Street block, west, will be demolished in 1910 to make room for the Vanderbilt Hotel.
On the horizon may be seen the new Hotel Belmont on the southwest corner of 42nd Street, and one dome of the old Grand Central Station. Compare this picture with Galloway's view of the west side of the avenue, looking north from this point, in 1930.

Note the name, The New York Elevated Railroad Co. on the top of the passenger cars.

Charles C. Harvey, the inventor, was permitted by the Legislature to build an experimental track along Greenwich Street, from Battery Place to W. 29th Street. The system was commenced in 1867 and the means of locomotion was a wire rope drawn by a stationary engine. This method was unsuccessful, and the matter lay in abeyance for several years. The Company failed in 1870 and was succeeded by the New York Elevated Co., which began the use of small locomotives on the tracks. The Manhattan Railway Co. was formed in 1875, and in 1879 it leased, for a term of 999 years, the New York Elevated Railroad and the Metropolitan Elevated Railway, both of which were chartered in 1872 and opened in 1878. The lease was modified in 1884. A copy of this scene is in the Bagoe Collection and is located as at 59th Street.
