  <p>This site provides an alternative way of browsing the <a
  href="http://www.nypl.org/">NYPL</a>'s incredible <a
  href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/explore/dgexplore.cfm?col_id=219">Photographic
  Views of New York City, 1870s-1970s</a> collection. Its goal is to help you
discover the history behind the places you see every day.</p>
  
  <p>And, if you're lucky, maybe you'll even discover something about New
  York's rich past that you never knew before!</p>

  <h3 style="padding-top: 5px;">Where did these images come from?</h3>

  <p>
  The images all come from the New York Public Library's <a
  href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/explore/dgexplore.cfm?col_id=219">Milstein Collection</a>. While many photographers contributed to the collection, the majority of its images are the work of Percy Loomis Sperr, who documented changes to the city from the late 1920s to the early 1940s.
  </p>

  <p>The Library retains the copyright for many of these images. For details,
  please read their <a
  href="http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/legal-notices/website-terms-and-conditions">Terms and Conditions</a> page.</p>

  <p>The creators of this site did not collect or digitize any of these images
  &mdash; credit for that massive undertaking belongs entirely to the
  Library.</p>

  <h3>Who built this site?</h3>
  <p>The site was built by <a
  href="http://twitter.com/#!/danvdk">@danvdk</a>, with help from <a
  href="http://twitter.com/#!/ravejk">@ravejk</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mdezube">@mdezube</a>. Assistance from the library came from <a href="https://twitter.com/riordan">@riordan</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mattknutzen">@mattknutzen</a> and the whole <a href="https://twitter.com/nypl_labs">@nypl_labs</a> team.</p>

  <h3>What did this site do?</h3>
  <p>The creators of this site associated <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitudes</a> and <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitudes</a> to the images in
  the Milstein collection. This process is known as <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocoding">geocoding</a>. Doing this
  allows the images to be placed at points on a map, which enables new ways of
  exploring this collection.</p>

  <p>They also detected individual photos on the original Milstein scans and
  extracted them. This reduced the appearance of large borders or multiple
  small images. You can read more about this process <a
  href="http://www.danvk.org/wp/2013-02-09/finding-pictures-in-pictures/">here</a>
and <a

  <h3>What's the story of this project?</h3>
  <p>Several years ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danvdk">@danvdk</a>
  created <a href="http://oldsf.org/">OldSF</a> using a collection of imagery
  from the SFPL. What with the nature of engineering projects, by the time he
  published it, he'd already moved from San Francisco to New York City.
  Extending the project to his new home seemed like a great idea. He met with
  <a href="https://twitter.com/mattknutzen">@mattknutzen</a>, who introduced
  him to the Milstein collection. It seemed like a perfect fit! After about 18
  months of on-again off-again effort, the site was ready for launch.</p>

  <h3>How can you help?</h3>
  <p>Please:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Like or Tweet the photos you enjoy. This helps us find the best
  photos.
    <li>Leave comments on the photos from your area telling us what's
  there now, what's changed, and what's stayed the same. These comments will enrich the site for everyone.
    <li>Transcribe text on "the back of the image" and leave it in a comment when you see these links.
    <li>Click that "rotate" link when you see rotated images.  It will help us
      fix these glitches in the future.
  </ul>
